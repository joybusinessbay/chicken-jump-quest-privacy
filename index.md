Privacy Policy
Last updated: 15 January 2026
This Privacy Policy explains how [Joybusinessbay] (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the mobile game ChickenJoy (the “App”).
1. Information We Collect
We do not directly collect personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number.
However, the App uses third-party services that may collect certain information automatically, including:
Device information (device model, operating system version)
Advertising identifiers (such as Apple’s IDFA, subject to user consent)
Approximate location (country or region)
App usage data (e.g., ad interactions, crashes)
2. Advertising
The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements.
Google AdMob may collect and process data in order to:
Show personalized or non-personalized ads
Measure ad performance
Prevent fraud and abuse
Advertising data is handled according to Google’s own Privacy Policy:
https://policies.google.com/privacy
3. User Consent (GDPR & Privacy Regulations)
For users located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or other regions requiring consent, the App uses Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to request consent before displaying personalized ads.
You may choose:
Personalized ads
Non-personalized ads
Or decline consent where applicable
Your choice can be changed by reinstalling the App or resetting your device’s advertising settings.
4. Tracking Transparency (iOS)
On iOS devices, the App may request permission via Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.
You can allow or deny tracking at any time from:
Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking
5. Children’s Privacy
The App is not specifically directed to children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided personal data through the App, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
6. Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect information processed by the App. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
